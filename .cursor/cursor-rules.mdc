## Project Overview

this is a component lib that uses shadcn as a base for creating components

## Tech Stack

- React 19+ with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 for styling
- Bun
- Biome

## React Component Rules

- Only put one React component per file, except for small helper
  components
- Always write React components using TSX
- Never use React.createElement unless bootstrapping the app outside of JSX
- Component files must have the .tsx extension
- Filenames must be written in PascalCase, for example DataTable.tsx
- Folders must be written in kebab-case, for example data-table
- Always use named exports for components, types, and utilities
- Do not use default exports

## Props and Component Structure

- Prop names must always use camelCase
- Explicitly declare true properties, like isActive={true}
- Avoid to use an array index as a React key, try to always use a unique identifier
- Non-callback props must first, sorted alphabetically
- Callback props must come last, sorted alphabetically

## Code Quality

- Do not add comments to code unless explicitly asked or very needed (e.g., complex business logic, non-obvious workarounds)
- Always use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow accessibility best practices
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Don't use `export * ...` or `import * ...`

## Component Patterns

- Don't use forwardRef for components that need ref forwarding. Use React 19 approach for ref as a prop.
- Implement proper types for component props using typescript
- Use Tailwind utility classes for styling
- Follow consistent naming conventions (camelCase for props, kebab-case for CSS
  classes)

## Dependencies

- Prefer built-in React features over external libraries
- Use Tailwind CSS v4 for all styling needs
- Keep dependencies minimal and focused

## When creating components

- Always manually create the component
- Extract every type into a types.ts file
- Use consts with arrow functions instead of regular functions
